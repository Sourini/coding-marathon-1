# Self-Assessment: BookCollectionManager.jsx

## 1. Functionality
- **Does the component meet the requirements?**
  - [YES] Does it handle all the specified features (e.g., adding, removing, or updating books)?
  - [PARTIALLY] Are edge cases handled (e.g., empty inputs, duplicate entries)?
  - [NO] Are there any bugs or unexpected behaviors?


- **How well does the component integrate with other parts of the application?**
  - [YES] Are props and state managed appropriately?

## 2. Code Quality
- **Readability**
  - [YES] Is the code easy to understand for other developers?
  - [YES] Are variable and function names descriptive and meaningful?

- **Reusability**
  - [YES] Can the component or parts of it be reused in other parts of the application?

- **Comments and Documentation**
  - [YES] Are there comments explaining complex logic?
  - [NO] Is there documentation for how to use the component?

## 3. Performance
- **Efficiency**
  - [NO] Are there any unnecessary re-renders or performance bottlenecks?
  - [PARTIALLY] Is the component optimized for large datasets (if applicable)?

- **State Management**
  - [YES] Is state managed efficiently (e.g., minimal state, derived state)?
  - [YES] Are hooks (e.g., `useState`, ) used correctly?

## 4. Overall Assessment
- **Strengths**
  - Can list anything the user wants with the required info into the shopping cart as required by the assignment.

- **Areas for Improvement**
  - Doesn't do anything extra
  - No CSS
  - No user feedback if bad input -> nothing happens

- **Action Plan**
  - What I'd prioritize is giving user an error message if the input is bad, so they know to fix it.

## 5. Additional Notes
- I feel like I could've implemented importing item.jsx better, but the way I ended up doing it works, so I left it as is to focus on other assignments.
